# Overview of the VBA Challenge
## Module 2 of Data Analytics Bootcamp
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to write code in VBA that can take in large amounts of data from the stock market in excel and filter through that data and present us with summarized information regarding the performance of each stock depending on the year. Additionally, we added some components within the code to help with the UI, including formatting the table that the data was presented in, and creating buttons to make running the analysis very easy and accessible for any user from within the excel workbook. Lastly, added some features that help the code run with under less strict parameters, checked how quickly VBA was running the analysis, and we refactored the code substituting in a tickerIndex variable and uses arrays to work with multiple variables at once, which eliminated the need for nested for loop in our code and helped the code run 2 to 3 times as quickly.
